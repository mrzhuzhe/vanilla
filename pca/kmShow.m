%% === Part 8(a): Optional (ungraded) Exercise: PCA for Visualization ===
%  One useful application of PCA is to use it to visualize high-dimensional
%  data. In the last K-Means exercise you ran K-Means on 3-dimensional
%  pixel colors of an image. We first visualize this output in 3D, and then
%  apply PCA to obtain a visualization in 2D.

% Re-load the image from the previous exercise and run K-Means on it
% For this to work, you need to complete the K-Means assignment first
A = double(imread('../k-mean/data/bird_small.png'));

% If imread does not work for you, you can try instead
%   load ('bird_small.mat');

A = A / 255;
img_size = size(A);
X = reshape(A, img_size(1) * img_size(2), 3);

max_iters = 10;
initial_centroids = kMeansInitCentroids(X, K);
[centroids, idx] = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters);

%  Sample 1000 random indexes (since working with all the data is
%  too expensive. If you have a fast computer, you may increase this.
sel = floor(rand(1000, 1) * size(X, 1)) + 1;

%  Setup Color Palette
palette = hsv(K);
colors = palette(idx(sel), :);

%  Visualize the data and centroid memberships in 3D

% Use PCA to project this cloud to 2D for visualization

% Subtract the mean to use PCA
